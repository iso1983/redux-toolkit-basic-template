Usage:

1)open 2 seperate terminals first in VS code or use bash/terminal

2)In the first terminal cd to directory:  /backend and then run: npm start

3)In the second terminal cd to directory: /frontend/test and then run: npm start

This is just a very basic template created by me using redux-toolkit with redux-thunk for async API calls.I created a file called db.json located in the backend folder to mimic the database,in real life this can be a database from an API.

Change the components depending on your needs, change styling, add more components or edit the existing components.At the end of the day this is how you use redux-toolkit in any of your projects.Consider this as a starting point and you can improve the code from this template.
