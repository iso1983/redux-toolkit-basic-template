**Usage**:<br>
redux.png is the image that contains the question

The question folder is the plane React app for the question.Start from the question folder and solve the question by applying Redux in the React app in the question folder.<br> <br>
The solution folder is the folder that contains the complete answer for the question.If you can't solve the question,just check the solution folder.

1)open 2 seperate terminals first in VS code or use bash/terminal

2)In the first terminal cd to directory:  /backend and then run: npm install and npm start

3)In the second terminal cd to directory: /frontend/ and then run:npm install and  npm start

This example shows how to implement Redux using redux-toolkit with redux-thunk for async API calls.I created a file called db.json located in the backend folder to mimic the database,in real life this can be a database from an API.

Change the components depending on your needs, change styling, add more components or edit the existing components.At the end of the day this is how you use redux-toolkit in any of your projects.Consider this as a starting point and you can improve the code from this template.
